## Introduction

Welcome to my write up for the 2025 SANS Holiday Hack Challenge! This is my second year attempting this annual challenge, and am excited to have completed all challenges for the first time!! 

!!! quote "Welcome to the SANS Holiday Hack Challenge 2025!"
    Way back in 2015, the mysterious Atnas Corporation almost ruined the entire holiday season through their nefarious Gnome In Your Home plot. Their villainy centered upon convincing parents to purchase little Gnome dolls that played joyful holiday songs to their children. With Gnome sales topping two million units, a blitz of Atnas Corp advertisements encouraged parents to move their Gnomes around the house daily so that their children could hunt for them in a fun little game. Little did parents know that these Gnomes were snooping IoT devices with a camera and wireless internet access, furtively sending photos to burglars who would rob their houses of their treasures en masse on Christmas Eve, 2015. The incredible efforts of SANS Holiday Hack investigators around the world foiled the foul plot, exposing the criminal mastermind behind Atlas Corp: Cindy Lou Who, age 62.<br/>

    But those old Gnomes didn’t disappear. They lay discarded, gathering dust on shelves, in attics, and among other forgotten places throughout the world. Until now. There must have been some magic in those Gnomes, because, due to some unseen spark, some haunting hocus pocus, the Gnomes have quickened and are now walking among us! We now return with the Counter Hack Crew to the Duke Dosis neighborhood as the Holiday Season 2025 unfolds.<br/>

This year's challenge appears to be a call back to the first Holiday Hack Challenge, 10 years ago. I thought this was both fun and realistic as so many modern vulnerabilities are a result of older technologies that remain within an environment for one reason or another. There is a Story Mode and CTF Mode with three acts. Each challenge from the previous Act must be completed to unlock the next Act. As oppossed to last year, each Act was available as soon as the previous Act was completed. This allowed me more time to spend on the challenges that needed more focus, which was an awesome improvement. I followed the story mode, walking around the map, exploring and talking to the in-game characters.

Follow along as I walk through each challenge. While I did try to take better notes this year, I also waited until I completed the entire challenge before starting this write up. :wink:

We start in Act 1:

!!! warning "Act 1"
    The Counter Hack crew is in the Neighborhood festively preparing for the holidays when they are suddenly overrun by lively Gnomes in Your Home! There must have been some magic in those Gnomes, because, due to some unseen spark, some haunting hocus pocus, they have come to life and are now scurrying around the Neighborhood.

Act 2: 

!!! note "Act 2"
    The Gnomes’ nefarious plot seems to involve stealing refrigerator parts. But why?

Act 3:

!!! info "Act 3"
    The Gnomes want to transform the neighborhood so that it’s frozen solid year-round, an environmental disaster. But who is the mastermind behind the Gnomes’ wickedness?

??? note "Counter Hack Crew"
    This year's competition introduced the Counter Hack team and some of their interests with each challenge. This was a fun and personal touch that I enjoyed. In the interest of space and time, I have taken each of the intros and presented them on a seperate [page](ch_crew.md), leaving just the challenge text for each walk-through. 

??? tip "Navigation tip"
    Depending on the challenge, there can be quite a bit of information to read through. To make things a little easier, you can use ++"P"++ or ++","++ to go to the previous section, ++"N"++ or ++"."++ to navigate to the next section, and ++"S"++, ++"F"++, or ++"/"++ to open up the search dialog.

    **TL;DR** if you keep pressing ++"N"++ or ++"."++ from this point forward, you'll hit all the content in the right order! :smile:

## Conclusion

??? success
    The Counter Hack crew discovers Frosty is behind the Gnome uprising and stops his freezing plot! Santa's compassionate offer to Frosty melts more than just snow, it melts hearts, saving the Neighborhood and proving that kindness conquers all.

It was really exciting to compare where I was last year with where I finished this year and be able to measure my growth. I look forward to challenging myself again next year!
