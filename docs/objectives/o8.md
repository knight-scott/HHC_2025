    The Neighborhood HOA uses Azure storage accounts for various IT operations.

    You've been asked to audit their storage security configuration to ensure no sensitive data is publicly accessible.

### Admonitions

!!! warning "Anchor the decorations"
    Ensure that all festive decorations, especially electrical ones, are securely anchored. We don’t want them floating off into the tropical sunset!

!!! info "Palm tree lighting tip"
    While on the island, make sure to hang your Christmas lights on a palm tree. It’s not only festive but also a great beacon for Santa to find you!
