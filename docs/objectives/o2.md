## Objective

!!! question "Request"
    Find Ed Skoudis upstairs in City Hall and help him troubleshoot a clever phishing tool in his cozy office.

??? quote "Ed Skoudis"
    Oh gosh, I could talk for hours about this stuff but I really need your help!

    The team has been working on this new SOC tool that helps triage phishing emails...and there are some...issues.

    We have had some pretty sketchy emails coming through and we need to make sure we block ALL of the indicators of compromise.

    Can you help me? No pressure...

## Hints

??? tip "Extract IOCs"
    Remember, the new Phishing Threat Analysis Station (PTAS) is still under construction. Even though the regex patterns are provided, they haven't been fine tuned. Some of the matches may need to be manually removed.

??? tip "Defang All The Thingz"
    The PTAS does a pretty good job at defanging, however, the feature we are still working on is one that defangs ALL scenarios. For now, you will need to write a custom `sed` command combining all defang options.

## Solution

The terminal link opens the *Dosis Neighborhood SOC* displaying an email and steps for investigating it.

    Dear Valued Dosis Neighborhood Residents,

    🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED 🚨

    Our elite team of Sunny's kitchen renovation specialists have detected some SERIOUSLY outdated kitchen setups in your neighborhood! It appears that certain homes are still using legacy appliances without proper smart home integration - like non-IoT fridges that can't automatically order milk, or microwaves that don't sync with your meal planning apps! 

    While this sounds like a delightfully festive renovation opportunity (and totally not a security assessment), we need you to:

    1. Download our FREE Kitchen Renovation Planner™ with built-in security features (totally legit, we promise!): https://icicleinnovations.mail/renovation-planner.exe
   
    2. Upload high-resolution photos of your current kitchen to our secure design portal (we need to see ALL angles for proper renovation planning): https://icicleinnovations.mail/upload_photos

    For instant help with any kitchen renovation questions, contact our 24/7 design hotline at 523.555.0100 or our renovation specialists at 523.555.0101.

    Remember: If your old appliances start acting up during the assessment, it's probably just excitement about their upcoming upgrades! But please document any issues with photos.

    Stay merry (and consider smart upgrades),
    Icicle Innovations 
    Chief Kitchen Design Specialist

    P.S. - Has anyone else noticed their kitchen cabinets mysteriously rearranging themselves overnight? We can fix that with proper smart storage solutions!

### Step 1: Extract IOCs

!!! danger "Extract IOCs"
    This phishing email may be connected to the mysterious Gnome activities reported throughout our neighborhood! Extracting IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) is essential to protect the Counter Hack Crew and identify the threat actors behind this campaign. Your mission:

    - [ ] Extract all suspicious **domains**, **IPs**, **URLs**, and **email address**.

PTAS has seperated each objective into a seperate tab, [++"DOMAIN"++](#domains), [++"IP ADDRESSES"++](#ip-addresses), [++"URLS"++](#urls), and [++"EMAIL ADDRESSES"++](#email-addresses)

#### Domains

To search the email for domains, we need a regex pattern that will find web addresses in the email.

??? tip "What are Domains?"
    Domains are human-readable web addresses (like example.com) that map to IP addresses. They often indicate the source or destination of malicious activity.

In the informatinal blurb about what a domain is, there is also a link to the reference tab (seen below) that provides some useful RegEx commands as well as resource links. Under "Common IOC patterns" can be found a regex pattern for detecting domains, `[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)+`. That seems to be just what is needed; copy and pasting it in the field returns a bit more than expected though, with a total of 14 domains found.

??? warning "Fine Tuning"
    If you read the hint provided, "Extract IOCs", you'll see that there is a warning about the PTAS being new and the RegEx patterns provided not all being fine tuned. In this case, that means needing to remove some of the findings. For other IOCs such as **IP Addresses**, it is necessary to adjust the RegEx Pattern.For every RegEx result, it is important to only list the IOCs in your findings being sure to remove any legitimate assets. 

![Domains found](../img/objectives/o2/domains.png)

Remove those found which are not domains and there should be left with each domain IOC highlighted and color coded on the phishing email.

![Highlights](../img/objectives/o2/email_domain.png)

Going through the other tabs with the RegEx pattern from the reference tab as a starting point to find and highlight the **IP ADDRESSES**, **URLS**, & **EMAIL ADDRESSES**. When you select the ++"EXTRACT"++ button, the phishing email will be highlighted with the corresponding color. Afterwards, review the matches and remove any that don't belong.

#### IP Addresses

??? info "What are IP Addresses?"
    IP addresses are numerical labels (like 192.168.1.1) that identify devices on a network. Malicious IPs may host command & control servers or malware.

The RegEx pattern for IP Addresses from the reference tab is `\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}` but if this pattern is used as is, you'll notice that the values returned do not match the ip addresses correctly. The pattern provided is not quite complete.

![IP Addresses](../img/objectives/o2/IP_addresses.png)

!!! success "IP Addresses"
    A more fine tuned pattern will match the final octet, which will provide complete IP addresses without including any false matches and can be done using `\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}`.

#### URLs

??? info "What are URLs?"
    URLs are web addresses (like http://example.com/path) that point to specific resources. Malicious URLs often lead to phishing sites or malware downloads.

!!! success "URLs"
    To find URLs with RegEx use `https://[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)+(:[0-9]+)?(/[^\s]*)?`

![URLS](../img/objectives/o2/urls.png)

#### Email Addresses

??? info "What are Email Addresses?"
    Email addresses (like user@example.com) identify senders and recipients. In security analysis, they can reveal phishing campaign sources or targets.

!!! success "Email"
    Email addresses can be found with `\b[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}\b`

![email addresses](../img/objectives/o2/emails.png)

After completing each RegEx extraction, the results are highlighted with color coding, a different color for each IOC.

!!! success "IOCs extracted"
    - [x] Extract all suspicious **domains**, **IPs**, **URLs**, and **email address**.

    ![Highlighted](../img/objectives/o2/highlighted_email.png)

!!! warning "Objective Note"
    A final note on extracting IOCs from the email. Remember that the objective for this step is "Extract all *suspicious* domains, IPs, URLs, and email addresses". Just because something is a match for the regex pattern that is being used does not necessarily mean that the match is suspicious. A search pattern that matches emails will match both sender and receiver emails. It is the analyst's job to then decide which matches are an indicator of compromise to report, and which are benign aspects of the organization. Only include those indicators that are not legitimate. 

---

### Step 2: Defang & Report

Once all of the Indicators of Compromise have been found and highlighted within the phishing email, it's time to move to step 2, which is to defang the IOCs and report the findings.

??? info "What is defanging"
    Defanging is a safety step of preventing indicators of compromise from accidentally being executed by changing or removing parts that break automatic functionality, such as wrapping a period or '@' with brackets (`[.]` & `[@]`). 

!!! warning "Defang IOCs"
    Defanging IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) is crucial to ensure that malicious content cannot be accidentally activated. This phishing campaign may be connected to the recent Gnome activities! Your mission:

    - [ ] Replace dots/periods with [.]<br/>
    - [ ] Replace @ in email addresses with [@]<br/>
    - [ ] Replace http with hxxp in URLs<br/>
    - [ ] Replace :// with [://] in URLs<br/>
    - [ ] Submit the defanged IOCs to the Counter Hack Security Team <br/> 

![Defang&Report](../img/objectives/o2/defang_objective.png)

In [Step 1](#step-1-extract-iocs), we used Regular Expression (RegEx) to search the phishing email for Indicators of Compromise. For Step 2 we are going to use another powerful searching tool, `sed`. 

??? info "`sed`"
    According to [geeksforgeeks.org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-unix/sed-command-in-linux-unix-with-examples/) the `sed` command, which stands for **s**tream **ed**itor, "is a non-interactive text editor used to perform basic text transformations". It goes line by line, applying edits per the commands provided.

The [hint](#hints) "*Defang All The Thingz*" mentions that the PTAS system does a good job, but that they are still working on a command that "defangs ALL scenarios". There are four buttons with quick defang commands which provide a custom `sed` command which can be used to build the required single command. 

#### Provided commands

The commands provided are below with a short description.

| Target | `sed` Command | Result |
| ------ | ------------- | ------ |
| `.` | `s/\./[.]/g` | replaces all dots (`.`) with the defanged version `[.]`, which uses the square brackets (`[]`) to prevent links from being executable, or 'clickable' |
| `@` | `s/@/[@]/g` | replaces the 'at'(`@) symbol common in emails with the defanged version, similar to the dot |
| HTTP | `s/http/hxxp/g` | changes 'http(s)' to hxxp(s) |
| `://` | `s/:\//[://]/g` | further reduces the chances of accidental link clicking by replacing the colon (`:`) and duble forward slash (`//`) with the square bracket wrapped version (`[://]`) |

After finding each of the IOCs, we can apply the defang commands one by one to see the effect and what the defanged IOC outcome will be. However, this is not sufficient to send to the security team. We need to craft a `sed` command that will apply all of the commands. Since the PTAS system doesn't have that function, we'll create our own in order to properly defang all IOCs before sending the report to the securithy team. The defang tab in fact instructs us how to chain multiple `sed` commands by using a semicolon (`;`). With this information, each of the above commands can be chained together for a final command that effectively defangs each IOC for reporting. Select apply, then "Send to Security Team" button at the bottom of the page.

!!! success "Defang All"
    `s/:\//[://]/g; s/http/hxxp/g; s/\./[.]/g; s/@/[@]/g`<br/>

    - [x] Replace dots/periods with [.]<br/>
    - [x] Replace @ in email addresses with [@]<br/>
    - [x] Replace http with hxxp in URLs<br/>
    - [x] Replace :// with [://] in URLs<br/>
    - [x] Submit the defanged IOCs to the Counter Hack Security Team<br/>
