## Objective

!!! question "Request"
    Chat with Yori near the apartment building about Santa's mysterious gift tracker and unravel the holiday mystery.

??? quote "Yori Kvitchko"
    Think you can check out this terminal for me? I need to use cURL to access the gift tracker system, but it has me stumped.

    Please see what you can do!

## Hints

??? tip "Web Requests without a Browser??"
    Since we don't have a web browser to connect to this HTTP service...There is another **c**ommon tool that yo**u** can use f**r**om the c**l**i. 

??? tip "Who is Netstat"
    Back in my day...we just used Netstat. I hear `ss` is the new kid on the block. A lot of the parameters are the same too...such as listing only the ports that are currently LISTENING on the system.

## Solution

Once again starting with a terminal, we are presented with the full challenge:
```bash title="Gift Tracking Terminal"
======= Neighborhood Santa-Tracking Service =======

Oh no! Mischievous gnomes have tampered with the neighborhood's Santa-tracking service,
built by the local tinkerer to help everyone know when Santa arrives on Christmas Eve!

The tracking application was originally configured to run on port 8080, but after the
gnomes' meddling, it's nowhere to be found. Without this tracker, nobody in the neighborhood
will know when to expect Santa's arrival!

The tinkerer needs your help to find out which port the santa_tracker process is 
currently using so the neighborhood tracking display can be updated before Christmas Eve!

Your task:
1. Use the 'ss' tool to identify which port the santa_tracker process is 
   listening on
2. Connect to that port to verify the service is running

Hint: The ss command can show you all listening TCP ports and the processes 
using them. Try: ss -tlnp

Good luck, and thank you for helping save the neighborhood's Christmas spirit!

We are get two tasks and a hint, including the first command to test. Hopping right in with the suggested command `ss -tlnp` returns:

```bash title="ss -tlnp"
State                  Recv-Q                 Send-Q                                 Local Address:Port                                  Peer Address:Port                 Process                 
LISTEN                 0                      5                                            0.0.0.0:12321                                      0.0.0.0:*                                            
```

Ok, well that looks like the first task has been completed. We can see port 12321 is listening. Now we just need to connect to it and verify the `santa-tracking` service is running on the discovered port. We have just the terminal to use though so we'll need a command line option to use, which the hint also points us to.<br/>

    Great work - thank you!

    Geez, maybe you can be my intern now!
