    I'm the Founder of Counter Hack Innovations, the team that brings you the SANS Holiday Hack Challenge for the last 22 years. I'm also the President of the SANS Technology Institute College, which has over 2,300 students studying for their Bachelor's Degrees, Master's Degrees, and various certificates. I was the original author of the SANS SEC504 (Incident Handling and Hacker Attacks) and SANS SEC560 (Enterprise Penetration Testing) courses. I love Capture the Flag games and puzzles. I've got a steampunk office filled with secret rooms, and I collect antique crypto systems and communication technologies. I've got an original Enigma machine (A726, from the early war years), a leaf of the Gutenberg Bible (1 John 2:3 to 4:16) from 1455, and a Kryha Liliput from the 1920s.

    If you spot a fire, let me know! I'm Kyle, and I've been around the Holiday Hack Challenge scene for years as arnydo - picked up multiple Super Honorable Mentions along the way.

    When I'm not fighting fires or hunting vulnerabilities, you'll find me on a unicycle or juggling - I once showed up a professional clown with his own clubs!

    My family and I love exploring those East Tennessee mountains, and honestly, geocaching teaches you a lot about finding hidden things - useful in both firefighting and hacking.

    Jared Folkins here! My favorite Christmas movie is White Christmas. You should find me on the socials and tell me what yours is. You know, I think Santa is right! It truly is better to give than to receive. I love singing Carols with my family! 🎵O holy night, the stars are brightly shining…🎵
