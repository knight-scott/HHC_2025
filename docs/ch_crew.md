    I'm the Founder of Counter Hack Innovations, the team that brings you the SANS Holiday Hack Challenge for the last 22 years. I'm also the President of the SANS Technology Institute College, which has over 2,300 students studying for their Bachelor's Degrees, Master's Degrees, and various certificates. I was the original author of the SANS SEC504 (Incident Handling and Hacker Attacks) and SANS SEC560 (Enterprise Penetration Testing) courses. I love Capture the Flag games and puzzles. I've got a steampunk office filled with secret rooms, and I collect antique crypto systems and communication technologies. I've got an original Enigma machine (A726, from the early war years), a leaf of the Gutenberg Bible (1 John 2:3 to 4:16) from 1455, and a Kryha Liliput from the 1920s.
