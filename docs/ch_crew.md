# Counter Hack Crew

    I'm the Founder of Counter Hack Innovations, the team that brings you the SANS Holiday Hack Challenge for the last 22 years. I'm also the President of the SANS Technology Institute College, which has over 2,300 students studying for their Bachelor's Degrees, Master's Degrees, and various certificates. I was the original author of the SANS SEC504 (Incident Handling and Hacker Attacks) and SANS SEC560 (Enterprise Penetration Testing) courses. I love Capture the Flag games and puzzles. I've got a steampunk office filled with secret rooms, and I collect antique crypto systems and communication technologies. I've got an original Enigma machine (A726, from the early war years), a leaf of the Gutenberg Bible (1 John 2:3 to 4:16) from 1455, and a Kryha Liliput from the 1920s.

    If you spot a fire, let me know! I'm Kyle, and I've been around the Holiday Hack Challenge scene for years as arnydo - picked up multiple Super Honorable Mentions along the way.

    When I'm not fighting fires or hunting vulnerabilities, you'll find me on a unicycle or juggling - I once showed up a professional clown with his own clubs!

    My family and I love exploring those East Tennessee mountains, and honestly, geocaching teaches you a lot about finding hidden things - useful in both firefighting and hacking.

    Jared Folkins here! My favorite Christmas movie is White Christmas. You should find me on the socials and tell me what yours is. You know, I think Santa is right! It truly is better to give than to receive. I love singing Carols with my family! 🎵O holy night, the stars are brightly shining…🎵

    Oh hi! Am I on the road again? I should buy souvenirs for the family.

    Loud shirts? Love them. Because - hey, if you aren't having fun, what are you even doing??

    And yes, finger guns are 100% appropriate for military portraits.

    ... We should get dessert soon!

    Hey, I'm Eric. As you can see, I'm an avid motorcyclist. And I love traveling the world with my wife.

    I enjoy being creative and making things. For example, a cybersecurity tool called Zero-E that I'm quite proud of, and the Baldur's Gate 3 mod called Manaflare. I'm even in the BG3 credits!

    I also make tools, ranges, and HHC worlds for Counter Hack. Yup, including the one you're in right now.

    But most of the time, I'm helping organizations in the real world be more secure. I do a bunch of different kinds of pentesting, but speciailize in network and physical.

    Some advice: stay laser-focused on your goals and don't let the distractions life throws at you lead you astray. That's how I ended up at Counter Hack!

    CLUCK CLU... I think I might be losing my mind. All the elves are gone and I'm still hearing voices.

## Mark DiVito

    I am an avid collector of things of the past. I love old technology. I love how it connects us to the past. Some remind me of my dad, who was an engineer on the Apollo 11 mission and helped develop the rendezvous and altimeter radar on the space craft.

    If you ever get into collecting things like vintage computers, here is a tip. Never forget to remove the RIFA capacitors from vintage computer power supplies when restoring a system. If not they can pop and fill the room with nasty smoke.

    I love vintage computing, it’s the very core of where and when it all began. I still enjoy writing programs in BASIC and have started re-learning Apple II assembly language. I started writing code in 1982 on a Commodore CBM.

    Sometimes it is the people no one can imagine anything of who do the things no one can imagine. - Alan Turing

    You never forget your first 8-bit system.

## Josh Wright

    I'm a teetotling hacker.

    I sleep about 4 hours a night.

    Photography is my hobby, but the anachronistic sort: before 1900.

    Teaching people how to hack and protect systems is my passion.
