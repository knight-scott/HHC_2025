# SANS Holiday Hack Challenge 2025

## About

---

This is my attempt at a write-up for the 2025 SANS and Counter Hack *Holiday Hack Challenge*. This document is based on the template I've modified from [crahan's](https://github.com/crahan) [HolidayHackChallengeTemplate](https://github.com/crahan/HolidayHackChallengeTemplate/) and uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) and the [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme. 

The templated version is also available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/knight-scott) [here](https://github.com/knight-scott/WriteUpTemplate) with instructions on using it yourself.

Examples of reports I've made with this template and their repositories can be found at:
